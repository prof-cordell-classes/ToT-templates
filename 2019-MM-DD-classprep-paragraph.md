# Class Prep: 2019-MM-DD

#### YOUR NAME

## ENTRY TITLE

In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for each class, you should prepare 1-2 paragraphs responding to each classâ€™ readings. I mean 1-2 paragraphs **in total**, *NOT* 1-2 paragraphs per reading. Your entries should synthesize and bring readings into conversation, and should focus on a few ideas you want to highlight rather than attempting to summarize everything in the readings. Your class prep fieldbook entries can make critical observations about the readings or they may ask questions.
